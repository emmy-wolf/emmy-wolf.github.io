    <p>Hi there! My name is <strong>Emmy Wolf</strong> and I am currently a Senior at the 
        University of Colorado, Boulder planning to graduate in May with a degree in Computer Science. 
        I use she/her pronouns and I am originally from California. My goals for Web Spring 2025 is to have
        a complete digital portfolio that includes some of my previous projects, my interests, and a way to access
        my LinkedIn profile. I love the outdoors and hanging out with loved ones and reading all different genres 
        of books! </p>
    <p>Here is a link to a Youtube video showcasing a fullstack web app that I developed with a few others for my Software Development course. <a href="https://youtu.be/GmA0xOdb8UI">Link</a></p>
