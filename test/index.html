  <h1>Reverse Wordle Phone Guess</h1>
  <div id="instructions"><br>
    The Phone Number Wordle Bot is going to try to guess your phone number! <br><br>
    Enter your real phone number so that it will appear above the random numbers as a guide. <br><br>
    Match your real phone number digits with the random digits that appear below it. (aka compare each column by verifying that the numbers on top of each other align)<br><br>
    Mark which digits are in the correct location by selecting <div id="green">(green)</div><br>
    or if the digit doesn't appear in that spot in your phone number select <div id="gray">(gray)</div>
    <br>
    If you mess up and select "Gray" on a number that was actually "Green" or vice versa....yikes that's a bad mistake on you, luckily just refresh the page and you can try again.
