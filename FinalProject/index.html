    <h1>Reverse Wordle Phone Guess</h1>
    <h4>
      The Phone Number Wordle Bot is going to try to guess your phone number! 
      Help it out by marking which digits are in the correct location (green),
      which ones are in your phone number but in the wrong spot (yellow), or 
      if the digit doesn't appear in the phone number at all (gray).
